        <h1>JS Introduction</h1>
        <p style="color: gray;">Imagine a website as a house. HTML is like the bricks and walls that give it structure. CSS is like the paint and decorations that make it look nice. But without JavaScript, the house won't have any lights or running water—nothing would work or move.

            JavaScript is what makes a website interactive. It's like adding electricity to the house. It lets you click buttons to open doors, turn on lights, or even play music. So, without JavaScript, a website would be like a house where nothing really happens—you could look at it. The video below shows a modal which is created using JavaScript JavaScript is used for frontend programming but it is also used for backend programming using Node.js. Lets take a step back and understand all these concepts one by one.</p>
            <h1>What is ECMAScript?</h1>
            <p style="color: gray;">ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!

                It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.
                Beginning in 1997, JavaScript has evolved into many versions.

                ECMAScript1 or ES1 was first released in 1997. 
                ECMAScript 2015 also known as ES6 was released in 2015 and a major revision to JavaScript was made.
                The latest version of JavaScript will be ECMaScript2022 (ES13) in 2022.
